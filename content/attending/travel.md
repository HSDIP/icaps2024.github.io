# Wildlife
As the Banff Centre and the town of Banff are in Banff National Park, various types of wildlife are often observed. Sightings range from different bird species to the most frequently encountered large mammals: elk, mountain goats, bears, and mountain lions.

Keep in mind that the wildlife you may encounter is just that — wild! Please ensure that you respect the animals' spaces and habitats while in the park. That perfect picture can sometimes lead to a compromising situation for both the subject and the photographer. For your safety and theirs, please treat them with respect and keep your distance. Please do not feed any of the animals, including the squirrels, as they are protected by law.

**Please do not feed any animals, this can result in animals becoming habituated to humans and could lead to them being put down.**

Elk can be fast and dangerous, especially during spring calving (May 15-July 1). If you encounter any elk, keep your distance. You must always stay at least three bus lengths away from elk. Do not use headphones on trails. It is always best to travel in groups and to be always aware of your surroundings. **If you see wildlife on the Banff Centre campus, please contact Security Services via the main switchboard by dialling '0' or calling 1.403.760.0098**.

It is your responsibility to educate yourself on the topic of wildlife and how to prepare for wildlife encounters.
Mountains can be dangerous. If you are planning an excursion, contact the Parks Canada Information Centre at **403.762.1550** for up-to-date weather and avalanche information, reports on trail conditions, and wildlife activity. Visit [https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/banff](https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/banff) for more information.

- [Tips to Respect Wildlife and Stay Safe *Including Bear Spray Info*](https://parks.canada.ca/voyage-travel/conseils-tips/faune-wildlife)

For vehicle use, wildlife signage along highways and some local roads are posted. Drive accordingly as you may see some animals crossing as you drive. Watch the road and the ditches alongside within these marked areas. Use extra caution when approaching curves/bends on roads and when reaching the crest of a hill.

# Weather and Packing Essentials

- This time of year has warm/hot days and cooler nights as the wind can make it quite chilly. We suggest packing clothes for weather ranging between 0℃ (at night) to 15℃ (during the day), with a small possibility of rain since we're in the mountains.
- Banff is at 1400 m elevation. Bring a water bottle and aim to stay hydrated.
- Sunscreen is also recommended as there are many days where it is all sun and no clouds.
- Alberta also has dry weather. Chapstick and lotion may be helpful.
- Pack clothing for warm days and chilly nights, this may include sweaters, jackets, hat, and gloves for fall type weather. Bring layers so you can easily put on a jacket/sweater if you get cold. Sturdy shoes are also recommended for walking into town and for hiking.
- There are areas that may be chillier than others, this can depend on sun exposure, proximity to water, altitude (especially when hiking).
- For those staying at the Banff Centre: the Banff Centre features a comprehensive workout facility and a pool.
